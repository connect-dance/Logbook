# The Connect.Dance Logbook

This is the logbook for the Connect.Dance project.
With this logbook I want to document the progress of the project and the decisions I make along the way.

## The Idea

I've been dancing for a few years now and I really like to go to West Coast Swing events.
However, I am really annoyed by the lack of a good way to find events near me.
Sure, there are WhatsApp groups and Facebook events, but they are not very user-friendly and don't provide a good overview of all events.
I want to have a single place where I can see all events near me and easily add them to my calendar.
The big idea is to create a platform where dancers can find and book events, and connect with other dancers.

## The Preface

I am a software engineer.
This has the advantage that I know how to build software.
However, this also has a huge disadvantage: I tend to over-engineer things. A lot.
I want to create beautiful, scalable, and maintainable systems, more automated and reliable than everything most engineers would dream of.
However, I also know that this is not the way to go.
I need to learn to build things quickly and iterate on them.
I need to apply product thinking and focus on the user experience.
The most important thing is to get something out there that people can use and that solves a real problem.
If the project is successful, I can still refactor and improve it later.
So, in some way this project will be my personal challenge to overcome my perfectionism and learn to build things quickly.
I know, I will sometimes absuletly hate this, because my head is full of potential improvements and I will have to ignore them.
But on the same time I will still adhere to good engineering practices, because I am not a monster.
Simple solutions are not the same as bad solutions.
It just means that I will have to decide what is really important and what is not.

## The MVP

What is the smallest thing I can build that solves the problem?
I want build up the project in very small steps, as I don't have a lot of time to work on it.
If I can't finish a step in a few hours, it's probably too big.
So, let's formulate the most basic user story for now:
"I, as a user, want to see a list of events near me."
And with "I", I mean me, because I am the only user for now.
Now the question is: Which events?
Again, I am the only user for now, so I will add the events of the dance school I am going to.
Everything else is another feature I can add later.

The first iteration will be a simple static website that shows a list of events.
Ther will be no backend, no database, no user authentication, no nothing.
How boring, right?
How will I add events?
I will just add them to the HTML file, because this is the simplest way to do it.
So what will be my tech stack?
HTML, some very basic CSS and a static web server.
Becaues I don't have much money to spend, I will just use GitHub Pages to host the website.
This does also save me the time to set up and maintain a server.
